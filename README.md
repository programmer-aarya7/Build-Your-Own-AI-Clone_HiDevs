##  What Askie Does

Askie is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based chatbot that allows users to:

- 1. Upload a **PDF** or enter a **URL**
- 2. Automatically **chunk and vectorize** the content using **FAISS + HuggingFace Embeddings**
- 3. Build a **retrieval chain** that fetches relevant chunks based on your queries
- 4. Generate **natural, contextual answers** using the **Mistral model via Ollama**
- 5. View the exact **source documents** used to answer your query
- 6. Optionally **log interactions** using **Arize AI** for observability

##  How Askie Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Upload or Input
- Upload a `.pdf` file OR enter a webpage URL.
- Askie reads and parses the content.

### 2️⃣ Chunk and Vectorize
- The content is chunked into small segments using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
- Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`.

### 3️⃣ Build RAG Pipeline
- Chunks are stored in a FAISS vector store.
- A retriever fetches the most relevant chunks when a question is asked.
- Mistral LLM via Ollama generates an answer based on these chunks.

### 4️⃣ Chat and Source Tracking
- Askie responds to your question in natural language.
- Displays **source document chunks** used in the response.
- (Optional) Logs prompt, response, and metadata to **Arize**.
